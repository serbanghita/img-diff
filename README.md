# img-diff

> An image is essentially an array of pixels. Each pixel can have three colour channels - red, green and blue. \
> Each channel is represented by an 8-bit value, which provides 256 discrete levels of colour. \
> Some images also have a fourth channel, called the Alpha channel, which is used for pixel transparency. \
> We shall restrict ourselves to using only the R, G and B channels. \
> A black and white image uses the same values for R, G and B channels for each pixel.
